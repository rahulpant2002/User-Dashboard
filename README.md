## User Management Dashboard
  Initialised a Vite + React project.
  DaisyUI added for making clean UI.

  Created Basic Folder Structure.
  Created The NavBar

  Fetched allUsers and Displayed in Table.
  Fetch a User By ID is created.

  Lifting Up of State, so as to access the All Users info in every Component

  Created the feature of Add a User.

  Added the Delete User Feature.

  Added the Edit User Detail Feature.

  Made the Application Responsive.

## Challenges
  Have Used TailwindCSS 4.0, since its new in the market so Integration was a bit different than earlier.

  Since the Project is small, so decided not to use Redux Store for the State Management...
  
  It  was difficult to manage allUsers in every component.

  So came up with the Approach of Lifting Up of State, so as to access the All Users info in every Component...

## Improvements
  As the number of users grows, implement pagination and sorting features to make the UI more efficient.

  A secured Login/SignUp feature should be added with help of Bcrypt.js and JWT Tokens for the Security and Authentication...

  OTP Verification in email, so as to have consistancy in DataSet...

  As the number of Users will increase, Redux Store will be optimal way to manage allUsers in every component.
